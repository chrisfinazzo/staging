title: Well, that explains it...

Long story short: I come home for semester break (having gotten a flu shot the last time I was in Chatham several weeks earlier) and promptly get sick within 72 hours. Something weird is going on.

_Note_: This actually happened a few weeks ago and thankfully it wasn’t serious and only lasted a day or so, but the Time Magazine article caught my eye.

title: "NYT’s Stone: Jobs doesn’t have cancer"
---

> Two people who are familiar with Mr. Jobs’s current medical treatment said he was not suffering from a recurrence of cancer, but a condition that was preventing his body from absorbing food. Doctors have also advised him to cut down on stress, which may be making the problem worse, these people said.

Although it does not lessen the severity of the situation, for the New York Times to report this as part of otherwise troubling [news][] concerning Jobs’ health, is a small, but important, silver lining.

I love when the Times does [these][] things. They have the integration of reporting and technology down to a science.
The guys at CSTV should pay particular attention, after they dismantled the [USC Athletics][] site beyond recognition with possibly the worst use of AJAX ever; even though almost all collegiate athletics departments who outsource their sites seem to suffer from the same problem.
This is Flash done the right way.

People are now using [YouTube as a reference tool][].

This reminds me of when I hear people reference a Wikipedia article for a class presentation, instead of the original source material used in the article. Even though Wikipedia’s accuracy has improved over the years and will continue to get better, YouTube’s reference capabilities will need to be refined before it gains mainstream acceptance. At least journalism classes over the past 4 years have instilled in me one unshakable practice: following the source links in an article back to find out where the information first appeared (Read: Plagiarism is Bad).

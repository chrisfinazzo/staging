The EU [just won’t quit][].

The only reason they don’t bother going after Apple is because of small market share. I admit I don’t use IE or Windows Media Player, (both products which the Union seems to have problems with) nor do I care how much of the market they have, but this issue needs to be put to rest. Although being able to get a copy of Windows without IE or Media Player would be nice, it’s not essential. I seriously wonder why they pay these lawyers at all.
